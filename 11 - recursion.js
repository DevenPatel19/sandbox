/**
 ** Recursion - a problem solving technique where the solution depends on solutions to smaller instances of the
 **              same problem. aka - when a function calls itself
 *
 *! Find yourself breaking down your problem into smaller versions of the same problem 
 *
 *! Every resursive solution needs to have a base case - a condition to terminate the recursion.
 *! Recurison may simplify solving a prblem BUT it does not always x-late t a faster solution. (could be worse).
